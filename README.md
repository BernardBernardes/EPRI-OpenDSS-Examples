## OpenDSS Example Files (EPRI)

This repository contains a copy of the example files provided with the official OpenDSS (Open Distribution System Simulator) installation, developed by EPRI (Electric Power Research Institute).

## Source of Files

The files were copied directly from the examples directory of the standard OpenDSS installation.

OpenDSS Version 10.2.0.1 - Columbus

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a quick and convenient way to access and consult the OpenDSS example files, without needing to install the software locally just to view them. Another goal is to make it easy to import these files into Google Colab or similar cloud-based platforms (such as Kaggle, Deepnote, or JupyterHub) for analysis and experimentation.
